    "\n",
    "\\**similarity search** allows us to find the most relevant vectors based on a given input. By passing a question to the vector store `vs_example`, we can retrieve the closest matches based on the selected search algorithm.  \n",

    "#### 🛠 How It Works  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input a question**  \n",
    "   - Pass a question or input text to `question` argument of `similarity_search()`.  \n",

    "   - The vector store searches for the most relevant matches using the specified **`search_algorithm`**.  \n",

    "   - The result contains the **top_k** most relevant entries along with their similarity scores, helping us understand how closely they match the input.  \n",

Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.  Excellent for busy people or commuters!</td>\n",

While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.</td>\n",

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.  Since I rediscoverd the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerly thanked me.</td>\n",

Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag.  I am proud to include it in my collection.  Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion.From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it.  It is a messege.  A guide book.  A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma.  There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.

Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

       "0  0.079705          oaf  amazon_reviews_25   ARDQ9KNB8K22N  000100039X  Cool book, I really like the quality of the production.  Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag.  I am proud to include it in my collection.  Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.  Excellent for busy people or commuters!            2\n",

Over the years I\"ve given it as a gift more times than I can count, and will continue to do so.  Addresses real life issues in a beautiful way and makes us reexamine our own attitude about how we see what happens in our lives.  So easy to read over and over.            4\n",

The 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but my dust jacket is long gone. This particular rendition has had many re-printings, for a reason: it\"s very popular. The textured paper, old-style typography, and leather cover are better than a plain-old paperback. The size is diminutive, which is perfect for this book.            5\n",

It\"s direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in, leaving you at peace.
